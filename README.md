# Go Gopher draws

The Go gopher is the mascot of the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). The mascot was originally designed by [Renee French](http://reneefrench.blogspot.ca/).

This repository contains some Sergi's versions of the Go Gopher.

This repository started one design focused, but after the second I decided to change that to just a repository for all my draws. Here is the list of designs:

* Gopher going to Munich [Oktoberfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest) and he's wearing a [lederhosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lederhosen) and a square pattern shirt with of course, a [Maß](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maß) of beer.

* Gopher's Go-society inspired by [f-society](http://mrrobot.wikia.com/wiki/Fsociety) from [Mr Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot).

## Notes
All designs were done with [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com) and then exported to SVG and PNG.
